Hello, world

# React training modules

## installing:

```bash
npm i
```

### Developing

```bash
npm run dev
```

this should start a hot-reloadable server on `localhost:9002`

hot-reload is handled by webpack https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/


TODO
 - You can use the CLI to modify the webpack-dev-server configuration with the following command: webpack serve --hot-only.
